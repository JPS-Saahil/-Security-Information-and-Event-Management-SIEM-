Abstract
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models for classifying the legitimacy of software applications based on their static attributes.
The primary objective is to enhance cybersecurity defenses by leveraging static analysis and machine learning methodologies to detect potential malware, while maintaining a low false positive rate and high detection accuracy.
Classification models such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost have been implemented and compared to identify the most effective approach.
