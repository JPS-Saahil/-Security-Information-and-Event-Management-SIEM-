# ðŸ“„ Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## Abstract
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models aimed at classifying the legitimacy of software applications based on their static attributes. The primary objective is to enhance cybersecurity defenses by leveraging static analysis combined with machine learning techniques to detect potential malware while maintaining a low false positive rate and high detection accuracy. The classification models implemented include Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, which have been compared to determine the most effective approach.

## Key Features
- **Static Malware Analysis**: Malware detection is performed without executing files.
- **Machine Learning-based Classification**: Utilizes Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost models for classification tasks.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space while retaining maximum variance.
- **Cross-Validation**: 15-Fold Cross-Validation is employed to ensure robust and generalizable model performance.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of feature space, variance, and model performance using Plotly and Matplotlib.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
